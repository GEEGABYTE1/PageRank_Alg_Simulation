# PageRank Simulation 🥇

VERY Basic Simulation of Google's PageRank Algorithm made in Python.

Algorithm only takes 3 websites (Vertices, or Nodes) only at once, but runs just like Google's PageRank. However, Google's PageRank takes more than a billion variables at once ;) 

The Graph data structure was used for the underlying base of the algorithm. 

Time Complexity: O(N)

To run the Algorithm, run `script.py`.

# Extras 

Percentages may be not accurate at all times, however still approaches the ratio of `2:1:2`

Made in Python 🐍
