# PageRank Simulation ü•á

VERY Basic Simulation of Google's PageRank Algorithm made in Python.

Algorithm only takes 3 websites (Vertices, or Nodes) only at once, but runs just like Google's PageRank. However, Google's PageRank takes more than a billion variables at once ;) 

The Graph data structure was used for the underlying base of the algorithm. 

Time Complexity: O(N)

To run the Algorithm, run `script.py`.

# Percentage Calculations

Let `'` denote a prime, which reflects an update of the vertex. 

- `x': z`
- `y': (1/2)x` 
- `z': 2y`

We can also state the relationship as:
`x = 2y = z`

# Extras 

Percentages may be not accurate at all times, however still approaches the ratio of `2:1:2`
